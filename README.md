# Fruit-Quality-Detection
The fruit quality detection system introduces an advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with a complex architecture designed to improve performance. The system aims to improve the ability to detect the difference in fruit quality by integrating additional methods into the CNN model. Key hyperparameters, including periods, batch size, and validation splits, have been carefully tuned to fine-tune the accuracy of the system. The batch size, which represents the number of images processed simultaneously during training, is an optimized strategy to be increased as the batch size decreases. The epoch represents the number of iterations of the learning process that adapt to the balance of optimizing accuracy without overfitting. Additionally, a separate analysis method is used to increase the order of evidence and increase the accuracy of the system by preventing bias during process training. This holistic approach increases the accuracy and confidence in the rating of the fruit quality testing system. Combining improved CNN algorithms and optimized hyperparameters, the system aims to revolutionize fruit quality assessment by providing a complex and robust solution to the classification challenge in agriculture.
